Homework 4 - NOT RELEVANT

Homework 6 -
	For this homework project, we added a feedback button to multiple pages using APEX. Every button leads to the feedback page which is non-modal. The feedback page is a pop-up that is not embedded in any other page. The feedback page takes comments/enhancement requests/bugs text and sends it to the APEX Team Development Tab. There, the development team can read the text and improve on the application.
